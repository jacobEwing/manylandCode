	This is just a handy place to keep and organize the excessive number of scripts
	used in the area "space" in Manyland.  This will allow us to keep track of them
	in a shared and readable manner, rather than having to search around the
	universe for and its subareas to find the right script for reference.

	<h3>Iota Hopper</h3>
	<p>
	The following scripts are currently used in the spaceship "iota hopper"
	(subarea of that name):
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>"console operations"
			<p>
				This is the main code used for warping around and for beaming down or docking. The interacting resides at the very top of the chair. It does three core operations:
				<ol>
					<li>Performs the graphical end and state change when warping:
						<ul>
							<li>placing the warp animation </li>
							<li>bumping the user upward to close the holder</li>
							<li>erasing the block at 0, -1, which breaks the feedback loop keeping the current location componets rendered (planet, station, etc.)</li>
							<li>removes their target state (e.g. "THEY AREN'T TARGET KARRAKAS")</li>
							<li>sets their new location state (e.g. "THEY ARE AT KARRAKAS")</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Provide feedback for operations that are not valid.  As of this writing that includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Pressing "beam" when not at a planet</li>
							<li>Pressing "dock" when not at a station<li>
							<li>Pressing "warp" with no target selected</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Handle beaming to planets or docking at stations
						<p>There needs to be a row here for every location in the universe that one would transition into (planet, station, etc.)</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>engage engines
			<p>
				Used in the "engage" button in the control panel.  Currenttly it gives them the
				"they push warp" action and removes their states of being "at" anything.  That
				is a problem though, because if they are somewhere and push warp without
				setting a course, then they lose their status of being at that place and
				beaming/docking won't work.  That state removal will have to be moved to the
				console operations script instead I think.
			<p>
		</li>
		<li>example_pong
			<p>
				A sample of the code that goes in the "pong" interacting for any additional
				graphics that need to be added to the scene (planets, stations, whatever).  The
				code is identical between them, but the name must be unique to each of them.
				For Karrakas, I'm currently using "KARRAKAS_PONG" as the interacting name.
			</p>
			<p>
				These need to be added as items to the planet_placer script, and a line added
				for each.
			</p>
			
		</li>
		<li>planet_placer
			<p>
				The actual code that handles the consistent placement of a
				planet/station/whatever.  It uses a looping technique described by Cyel in the
				code sharing board.
			</p>
			<p>
				There must be one pair of lines for each circumstance that has elements added
				to it.  One of those lines places the pong interacting and pings it.  The other
				line, upon hearing the pong, places the objects and sends another ping,
				repeating the cycle.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>remove stuff
			<p>
				Used to remove items worn when transitioning into the ship, and to remove
				states of transition (they aren't fromstationmain, removes *, etc.)
			</p>

			<p>
				At the moment, this script winds up removing a bunch of things "/THEY AREN'T
				FROMSTATION9B /THEY AREN'T FROMSTATIONMAIN..." It seems to me that we can
				choose universal states like "leaving ship" and "entering ship" to go between
				all of the various transitions.  As is the scripts in the transitional worlds
				have a case for each individual ship they could be transferring to, so we could
				make the scripts more consistent this way without adding code.  I'll look into
				this soon.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
