/*
ANIMATE_TRANSITION
------------------------------------------------
THIS IS THE SCRIPT THAT SHOULD BE ALTERED ON A PER-CASE BASIS.  IT SHOULD DO THE ACTUAL DEPARTURE AND ARRIVAL ANIMATIONS, AND WILL BE CALLED BY THE ON_ARRIVAL SCRIPT

NOTE THAT THE "ANIMATE DEPARTURE" PART ENDS WITH /RETURN TO SHIP.  THIS TRIGGERS CODE IN THE GLOBAL INTERACTING THAT SENDS THEM TO THEIR APPROPRIATE SHIP.  THAT REMOVES THE NEED TO CHECK WHAT SHIPS THEY HAVE IN EVERY TRANSITION SCENE.
