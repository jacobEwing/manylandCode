/*
AS OF THIS WRITING, THIS CODE DOES ONLY TWO THINGS:
 1) SEND ONE TO THEIR SHIP UPON SAYING "BEAM ME UP"
 2) SEND ONE TO THEIR SHIP WHEN TRIGGERED BY INTERACTINGS

THE LATTER OF THOSE IS DONE PRETTY SIMPLY.  IN EACH WARP SCENE OR THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INTERACTING CALLED "ANIMATE TRANSITION" WHICH CONTAINS THE COMMAND "/RETURN TO SHIP".  THAT SHOULD TAKE THEM THERE.
