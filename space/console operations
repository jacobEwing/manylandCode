THIS TOP CLUSTER OF LINES HANDLES THE WARP BUTTON BEING PUSHED.
A CUSTOM ONE IS NEEDED FOR EVERY PLANET/STATION/ETC.

A BREAKDOWN OF THE FORMAT:
-------
SOMEONE DOES PUSH WARP AND THEY ARE TARGET [TARGETNAME]:
    THEY'VE PUSHED THE WARP BUTTON AND HAVE A PARTICULAR
    TARGET SET ON THE INTERFACE.

PLACES ZOOM:
    THAT'S THE WARP TUNNEL HAPPENING

BUMPS:
    CLOSES THE CONSOLE HOLDER

PLACES NOTHING:
    TEMPORARILY ERASES THE INTERACTING THAT PLACES THE
    IMAGES OF THE PLANETS/STATIONS ETC. IN VIEW.  THIS
    EFFECTIVELY RESETS IT, CAUSING IT TO DRAW THE RIGHT
    IMAGE FOR THE NEW LOCATION

THEY AREN'T TARGET [TARGET], THEY ARE AT [LOCATION]
    NO LONGER ARE THEY DESTINED THERE, THEY'RE NOW
    ACTUALLY THERE.
