	This is just a handy place to keep and organize the excessive number of scripts
	used in the area "space" in Manyland.  This will allow us to keep track of them
	in a shared and readable manner, rather than having to search around the
	universe for and its subareas to find the right script for reference.
	</p>

	<h3>Iota Hopper</h3>
	<p>
	The following scripts are currently used in the spaceship "iota hopper"
	(subarea of that name).  The are all placed directly above the player.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>console operations
			<p>
				This is the main code used for warping around and for beaming down or docking. The interacting resides at the very top of the chair. It does three core operations:
				<ol>
					<li>Performs the graphical end and state change when warping:
						<ul>
							<li>placing the warp animation </li>
							<li>bumping the user upward to close the holder</li>
							<li>erasing the block at 0, -1, which breaks the feedback loop keeping the current location componets rendered (planet, station, etc.)</li>
							<li>gives them the action "TARGET RESET", which triggers the script of that name execute</li>
							<li>sets their new location state (e.g. "THEY ARE AT KARRAKAS")</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Provide feedback for operations that are not valid.  As of this writing that includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Pressing "beam" when not at a planet</li>
							<li>Pressing "dock" when not at a station</li>
							<li>Pressing "warp" with no target selected</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Handle beaming to planets or docking at stations
						<p>There needs to be a row here for every location in the universe that one would transition into (planet, station, etc.)</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>target reset
			<p>
				Perhaps not the perfect name for the script, it currently does two things:
				<ul>
					<li>Removes the player's target state (e.g. "THEY AREN'T TARGET KARRAKAS")</li>
					<li>Remove their location state (e.g. "THEY AREN'T AT KARRAKAS")</li>
				</ul>
				This is called after the warp animation is initiated and before the player's
				new "AT" state is assigned.
			</p>
			<p>
				This will be a great potential place to put code that needs to be executed on
				every single warp but that does not differ between locations, reducing the
				actual amount of code used.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>example_pong
			<p>
				A sample of the code that goes in the "pong" interacting for any additional
				graphics that need to be added to the scene (planets, stations, whatever).  The
				code is identical between them, but the name must be unique to each of them.
				For Karrakas, I'm currently using "KARRAKAS_PONG" as the interacting name.
			</p>
			<p>
				These need to be added as items to the planet_placer script, and a line added
				for each.
			</p>
			
		</li>
		<li>planet_placer
			<p>
				The actual code that handles the consistent placement of a
				planet/station/whatever.  It uses a looping technique described by Cyel in the
				code sharing board.
			</p>
			<p>
				There must be one pair of lines for each circumstance that has elements added
				to it.  One of those lines places the pong interacting and pings it.  The other
				line, upon hearing the pong, places the objects and sends another ping,
				repeating the cycle.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>remove stuff
			<p>
				Used to remove items worn when transitioning into the ship, and to remove
				states of transition (they aren't fromstationmain, removes *, etc.)
			</p>

			<p>
				At the moment, this script winds up removing a bunch of things "/THEY AREN'T
				FROMSTATION9B /THEY AREN'T FROMSTATIONMAIN..." It seems to me that we can
				choose universal states like "SHIP DEPARTURE" and "SHIP ARRIVAL" to go between
				all of the various transitions.  As it is, the scripts in the transitional
				worlds have a case for each individual ship they could be transferring to, so
				we could make the scripts more consistent this way without adding code.  I'll
				look into this soon.
			</p>
		</li>

	<p>
	There is also some minor code in use in the holders that are the ship's console:
	</p>

	<h5>Action Buttons</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Warp
			<p> Causes the player to use the "PUSH WARP" action, which triggers the console
			operations script to process the warping given their current state.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Dock
			<p>Make the player use the "DOCK STATION" action, which initiates that sequence
			in console operations</p>
		</li>
		<li>Beam
			<p> Uses the "BEAM DOWN" action, which also triggers actions in console
			operations</p>
		</li>
		<li>Plot course
			<p>Opens the holder that lets you select your target by navigating between
			options.  Any location within opens a holder that should contain a description,
			a close button, and a "set target" button.</p>

			<p>As of this writing, the set target button has to go through all possible
			target states and modify them appropriately.  This is a problem, as it means
			that every single additional location requires updating those buttons.  This
			will be problematic and should be moved to console operations.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
