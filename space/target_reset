/*
This big-ass one-liner's sole purpose is to remove the states "at <location>"
and "target <location>".  It's called when the "console operations" script is
executing a warp.  We split it off here so that we don't have to add one of the
"they aren't at" statements to every warp setup in the conole operations
script.

Every time a planet is added to the universe, a corresponding pair of /they
aren't at and /they aren't target will need to be added here.
